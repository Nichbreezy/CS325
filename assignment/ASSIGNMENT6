            ASSIGNMENT 6
1). Consider two microprocessors having 8-bit and 16-bit wide external
 data buses, respectively. The two processors are identical, otherwise and
 their bus cycles take just as long

 a). If all instructions and operands are two bytes long, by what factor
 do the maximum data transfer rates differ?

 - The maximum data transfer rate differ is approximately a ratio of 1.2, because
 16 bites is twice the clock cycle  of a 8 byte which runs 2 bytes per minute.

 b). If half the instructions and operands are one bytes long, by what factor
  do the maximum data transfer rates differ?
  - The data transfer rate of 50 because 50 is enough for the bus cycle to
   transfer to the operand.
*/
/*
2). If a 32-bit microprocessor having 32-bit instructions which consists
of a 1 byte opcode and the remainder either an operand or the address of the operand

a). what is the maximum directly addressable memory capacity (in bytes)?

b). how many bits are needed for the program counter and the instruction register?
*/
/*
3). Write an int C++ function named DataBusTransfer() that takes an ifstream
reference parameter, of- stream reference parameter and an int parameter named
memory, cpu and width respectively. Given that memory references a file that
consisting of only of 1s and 0s and width is positive, the function writes a
line of read characters from memory into cpu every time width number of characters
are read from memory or when you reached the end of the file of memory.
Afterwards, the function returns the number of lines it wrote in cpu
